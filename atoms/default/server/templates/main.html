</div><p>A majority of Australia is either privately owned or controlled, according to Guardian Australia analysis of mapping and state tenure data.</p><p>About 38% of Australia’s land is covered by pastoral stations, a further 15% is private freehold land, and just 17% is controlled by Indigenous Communities. The last 30% is publicly-owned.</p><p>Data on the ultimate owners of Australian property is opaque. But by linking datasets sourced from each state, The Guardian can show just a handful of investors, firms and families control the vast majority of pastoral land.</p><p>The top 20 pastoral landholders in Western Australia, South Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland alone account for almost 50% of all pastoral ownership records we could find.</p><p>Control of Australian land also varies wildly between states. The biggest chunk of the Northern Territory, around 48%, is Indigenous controlled. Over 60% of Tasmania is public land, and 64% of Queensland is pastoral land.</p><p>23% of South Australia is also Indigenous land, perhaps reflecting that it was the first state to grant limited Indigenous land rights in 1966. Less than 1% of New South Wales and Victoria are controlled by Indigenous communities.</p><p>Meanwhile, almost all of the Australian Capital Territory is public land, with privately controlled parcels released only under 99 year leases.</p></div></div></div><div class="full-width-container">

<div class="content__main"><div class="gs-container"><div class="content__main-column content__main-column--interactive"><h2>The largest pastoral landholders</h2><p>Using data from the Western Australian and Northern Territory brand databases, as well as media reports, Guardian Australia identified many of the largest landowners in Australia.</p><p>Around 13.8% of Australia’s agricultural land is foreign owned, according the Foreign Investment Review Board. This includes Cubbie Station, one of the largest irrigated properties in the South Hemisphere, owned by Chinese multinational the Ruyi Group.</p><p>Consolidated Pastoral Company, one of the largest cattle companies in Australia, is the twelfth largest landowner in our data. Previously owned by a British Private Equity company, it was recently bought out by British investors.</p><p>All up, 9 of the largest 100 pastoral landholders that Guardian Australia could identify are foreign companies.</p><p>Some pastoral landowners are themselves more publicly controlled. The Queensland Government controls the North Australian Pastoral Company, one of Australia’s largest landowners in Australia, and the largest in our dataset, through its investment corporation.</p><p>The Australian Agricultural Company, the third largest landholder we found, is publicly traded on the Australian Stock Exchange. And the Indigenous Land and Sea Corporation is the 31st largest pastoral holder in our dataset.</p><h2>Miners buy up big</h2><p>Entities related to Gine Rinehart are some of Australia’s largest pastoral landowners. Australian Outback Beef, a joint venture between Hancock Prospecting and Shanghai-based Shanghai CRED Real Estate Stock Co are the second largest pastoral operators in Western Australia, Queensland, the Northern Territory and South Australia.</p><p>Separately, Rinehart’s investment vehicle Hancock Prospecting has its own large portfolio of agricultural properties. Hancock Prospecting is itself the 35th largest landowner in our dataset.</p><p>Gina Rinehart recently put almost 2 million hectares of pastoral lands up for sale in Western Australia and the Northern Territory.</p><p>Meanwhile Australian mining billionaire Andrew Forrest has also expanded his pastoral portfolio, through his Harvest Road Group. Harvest Road Group ranks 63rd in our dataset, just behind Australian mining giant BHP at 54th.</p></div></div></div><div class="full-width-container">

<div class="content__main"><div class="gs-container"><div class="content__main-column content__main-column--interactive"><h2>Changing face of Australia</h2><p>Data from the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment shows that agriculture makes up about 55% of Australian land use. The Guardian’s analysis used a subset of this, large pastoral stations.</p><p>Studies earlier in the 2000s showed that farmland was consolidating at a much faster rate than other rural land. And that larger properties were more likely to change hands than smaller ones.</p><p>Indigenous ownership has expanded as a result of court decisions like Mabo and increased recognition of Native Title. Before 1965 there was no legal recognition of Indigenous land ownership, even if some Crown Land was reserved for exclusive use by Indigenous communities.</p><p>In 1993, the Australian Bureau of Statistics calculated that around 14%, or just over 109 million hectares, was owned by Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders.</p><p>The amount of Indigenous controlled land has increased since then, to around 134 million hectares, according to a recent report by the Department of Agriculture. Around 170 million hectares in total come under Indigenous management or co management.</p><h2>How to figure out who controls Australia</h2><p>The data on land ownership and tenure is held by various governments in Australia. The rights and duties given to landholders can also vary between states and territories, given differing legal jurisdictions and court cases.</p><p>This makes the system incredibly opaque. The Guardian had to source map data from every state and territory government, as well as the federal government. A national land tenure dataset does exist. But it is compiled by a publicly owned company and access is sold as a subscription for more than $7,500 per user per year.</p><p>Some of the states also charge for their land use data, and others would not release data on pastoral land at all. Calculating land ownership and control in these instances either requires inferring what land is from meta descriptions, or doing without.</p><p>The Guardian was not able to source data on named pastoral stations from New South Wales or Victoria.</p><p>Classifying ownership and control was similarly challenging, as what constitutes control can vary significantly given legal jurisdictions, and may be a matter of opinion.</p><p>Indigenous peoples have some level of rights or interests over about 40% of Australia, for instance, according to the National Indigenous Australians Agency. However, in practice, much of this land is only “owned” by Indigenous Communities in so much as they have free access for specific activities.</p><p>The Guardian settled on a more restricted definition of Indigenous ownership, mainly consisting of freehold land owned and managed by Indigenous communities.</p><p>Similarly, even though pastoral stations and other agricultural land is bought and sold in huge transactions, much of it is publicly-owned land released under perpetual or extremely long leases.</p><p>________________</p><h2>Notes and methods:</h2><p><ul></p><p><li>Cadastral and tenure datasets were sourced from each state and territory, with properties categorised as either public or privately owned/controlled depending on tenure categories.</li></p><p><li>Pastoral spatial data was sourced from state/territory governments or extracted from cadastral/tenure datasets using tenure types and other metadata.</li></p><p><li>Indigenous owned land was identified using the Australia’s Indigenous land and forest estate dataset from the Department of Agriculture, Water and Environment. This dataset classifies Indigenous owned land as freehold lands that are both owned and managed by Indigenous communities. </li></p><p><li>Pastoral lease owners were initially sourced from the Weekly Times. This was expanded using other media reports, company websites and statements. Additional data was sourced from the Northern Territory and Western Australian brands databases. These were attached to pastoral spatial data using the name of the station, where available.</li></p><p><li>Area calculations for each category, and for individual owners, were made by reprojecting the map into Australian Albers, dissolving and summing the area</li></p><p><li>Dr Francis Markham, Research Fellow at the ANU Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research, assisted with collection data and context around Indigenous land ownership </li></p><p></ul></p></div></div></div><div class="footer" id="footer">
